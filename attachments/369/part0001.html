i want to open a file by subset of processes without knowing to other processes i.e other processes may open other file at some other time<br><br><br>is it possible through MPI_FILE_OPEN<br><br>in the begning i don&#39;t know which subset of processes will open the file<br>
<br>so i can not create MPI_COMM bycalling MPI_COMM_create through all the processes<br><br>please give a solution<br>
