<div dir="ltr">Hi!<br>I have some problems with mpich2 configuration. Here I added the configure.log and config.log. <br>I have tried both inpath-build and vpath build. I am using suse 10.3 and maybe I will try on suse 11.0 too both on x86_64 architecture. The programs that I am using can be found in config.log.<br>
So I want to learn what is problem and I want to learn the best configuration flags and options for my system.<br><br>Thanks!<br></div>
