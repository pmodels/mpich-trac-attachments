<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am currently facing problems in opening and reading files &gt;2GB. I am getting following error.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&quot;File locking failed in ADIOI_Set_lock. If the file system is NFS, you need to use NFS version 3, ensure that the lockd daemon is running on all the machines,<br>and mount the directory with the &#39;noac&#39; option (no attribute caching).<br>
[4] MPI Abort by user Aborting program !<br>[4] Aborting program!&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The file system is GPFS. Please let me know if you need any other information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Karthik</div>
