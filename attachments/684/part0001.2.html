  How much is the time difference between the 64-bit and 32-bit versions?<br>  You may also want to try with a single 64-bit OS and compiling<br>  separately for 32-bit or 64-bit via the -m32 and -m64 options to gcc and<br>

 Sorry, but I didn&#39;t understand about compiling. I compile like it is described in the install.pdf, through commands:<br>&gt;/home/you/libraries/mpich2-1.1/configure -prefix=/home/you/mpich2-install 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee c.txt<br>
and then &gt;make 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee m.txt and &gt;make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee mi.txt<br>How should I compile with -m32 and -m64 options? These optitions are invalid for commands configure and make. Or should I compile separately each source-file of mpich2  with gcc and gfortran? I don&#39;t completely understand how to carry out such compilation, and  whether it will work after this separate compilation. Is there any description of it in ../mpich2-1.1/doc/ ?<br>
