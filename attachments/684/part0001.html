Hi<br><br>My name is Alex Mazheika. I use mpich2 for quantum chemical calculations under Linux (I compiled the program package Espresso (<a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">www.quantum-espresso.org</a>) with mpich2 and apply it for parallel processes calculations). I noticed a strange phenomenon. The CPU of my PC is Intel Core Quad (64-bit). When I make my calculations under 64-bit linux-system (openSUSE 11.0, Fedora 10, Mandriva) it lasts longer than under 32-bit one (openSUSE-11.0). In both cases I compiled mpich2-1.1 (or earlier versions) from source-files with gcc, gfortran. The specifying<br>
  &gt; mpiexec -arch x86_64 ...<br> doesn&#39;t change anything. Is it OK? Or should I  change any options during compiling of mpich2 or of my Espresso-package? Or, maby, it needs to specify anything in command console  by starting of mpiexec?<br>
 <br>thank you in advance<br><br>regards,<br>Alex Mazheika, Research institut for Physical Chemical Problems of BSU, Leningradskayastr. 14, 220050 Minsk, Belarus<br>
