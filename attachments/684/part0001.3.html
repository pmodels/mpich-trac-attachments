You can use a 64-bit OS and set the environment variables CC, CXX, F77,<br>  F90 to &quot;gcc -m32&quot;, &quot;g++ -m32&quot;, &quot;gfortran -m32&quot;, &quot;gfortran -m32&quot;. Then<br>  run configure, make clean, make, make install as usual. That will create<br>
  32-bit binaries on a 64-bit OS. See how that performs compared with<br>  regular 64-bit binaries on the 64-bit OS.<br><br>  Rajeev<br></blockquote></div><br>I used 64-bit OS and compiled mpich2 like you had described, before installation I set: <br>
under bash &gt;set gcc -m64 (or g++,gfortran)<br>under tcsh &gt;setenv gcc -m64<br>With -m32 I have done analogously. And no change was considered. Under 32-bit system my processes last quicklier.<br>If I set &quot;&gt;set CC -m64&quot; (CXX, F77, F90), it writes by configuration:<br>
&quot;checking for gcc... -m64<br>checking for C compiler default output file name... <br>configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables<br>See `config.log&#39; for more details.&quot;<br>So it don&#39;t want to run qiucklier under 64-bit than under 32-bit OS by any setting of environment variables. It seems me that maybe the reason lies in my Espresso-program (<a href="http://www.pwscf.org">www.pwscf.org</a>), because I didn&#39;t try to run any other multiple process through mpich2, only Espresso. Or is there any other ideas?<br>
