  I suspect that your remaining problem with F90 was fixed in r4896 (missing<br>  eval in <a href="http://configure.in">configure.in</a>).  Would you be willing to try two more things?<br><br>  1. Run {{{file /home/user/mpich2-install/lib/*}}} and send us the output.<br>
  This should hopefully confirm my theory that you are getting a 64-bit f90<br>  library despite trying to build it as 32-bit.  Please also send your<br>  config.log.<br>  2. Try building the following tarball instead of mpich2-1.1.  It should<br>
  contain the r4896 fix, which will hopefully solve the remainder of your<br>  problem:<br>  <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/downloads/tarballs/nightly/trunk/mpich2-trunk-r4938.tar.gz">http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/downloads/tarballs/nightly/trunk/mpich2-trunk-r4938.tar.gz</a><br>
<br>  -Dave<br></blockquote></div><br>I&#39;m sorry, I misinformed you a little in  my  previous letter. I retried to install mpich2 under 64-bit OS with commands -m32 and -m64 (CC/CXX/F77/F90 I wrote with small letters):<br>
 &gt;...configure cc=&quot;gcc -m32&quot; cxx=&quot;g++ -m32&quot; f77=&quot;gfortran -m32&quot; f90=&quot;gfortran -m32&quot; gfortran=&quot;gfortran -m32&quot; -prefix=...<br>and<br>&gt;...configure cc=&quot;gcc -m64&quot; cxx=&quot;g++ -m64&quot; f77=&quot;gfortran -m64&quot; f90=&quot;gfortran -m64&quot; gfortran=&quot;gfortran -m64&quot; -prefix=...<br>
And then I compiled my program in each case. It was everything without problems (in my  previous letter it was my mistake by installation of mpich2). After that I checked the time   during a multiprocess calculation  in both cases. So under 64-bit OS both by installation with -m32 and with -m64 the same calculation lasts ~9 min. Under 32-bit OS it lasts ~8 min.<br>
The  multiprocess calculation with mpich2-trunk-r4938 I test today under 64-OS and tomorrow I report results.<br><br>Alexej Mazheika<br>
