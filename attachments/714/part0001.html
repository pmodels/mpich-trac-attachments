<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hi,<BR>
&nbsp;You should be able to build wmpiexec, wmpiconfig &amp; wmpiregister from the MPICH2 source (Build the projects from mpich2 solution file, mpich2.sln, using the &quot;Release&quot; configuration with VS). Or you can use the wrapper binaries that are installed with the 32-bit/IA32 version of MPICH2.<BR>
&nbsp;You can follow this ticket to know the progress on the effort to add the wrapper utils to MPICH2 64-bit installables (I am not sure if this would make it to the 1.1.1 release - to be released in couple of days - but will certainly make it to the 1.1.2 release - to be release in a month or so).<BR>
