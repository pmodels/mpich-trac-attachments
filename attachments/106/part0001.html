<div dir="ltr">Dear Sir/Ma&#39;am:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m a user of MPICH2. I would like to run MPICH2 on pvfs file system. But it seems only running in functions under /common. What should I do during installing MPICH2 to enable it running on PVFS?<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas<br></div>
