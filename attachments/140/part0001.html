<body class='hmmessage'>Hi...<br>I am new in MPI programming and I really need help!!<br>I use fortran 77 and MPICH2 with Windows. Is it possible to implement a program with 1 master.exe and several slaves.exe in which the slaves are not generated all <br>at once but can born successively during the computation?<br>I try to explain better: I want to check, during the computation, if a new slave.exe is needed or not....just if it&nbsp; is needed I want to call a new process...<br>Can I use the comand&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>call&nbsp; MPI_COMM_SPAWN&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>to generate 1 process at time&nbsp; or is there a more specific MPI-command???<br><br><br>PLEASE HELP ME!!!<br><a href="http://www.messenger.it/biglietti_da_visita.html" target="_blank"></a>
