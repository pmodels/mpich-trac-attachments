Dear sir or madam,<br><br>I upgraded recently to gcc-4.3 and I&#39;m finding trouble to execute my MPI programs. Indeed, when executing an MPI program with mpiexec sometimes it terminates correctly and sometimes it shows different error messages such as:<br>
<br>rank 2 in job 1&nbsp; mahmoud-desktop_33023&nbsp;&nbsp; caused collective abort of all ranks<br>&nbsp; exit status of rank 2: killed by signal 9 <br><br>or<br><br><br>[cli_1]: aborting job:<br>Fatal error in MPI_Allreduce: Other MPI error, error stack:<br>
MPI_Allreduce(696)........................: MPI_Allreduce(sbuf=0x8103344, rbuf=0x8103348, count=1, MPI_UNSIGNED, MPI_SUM, MPI_COMM_WORLD) failed<br>MPIR_Allreduce(285).......................: <br>MPIC_Sendrecv(161)........................: <br>
MPIC_Wait(321)............................: <br>MPIDI_CH3_Progress_wait(199)..............: an error occurred while handling an event returned by MPIDU_Sock_Wait()<br>MPIDI_CH3I_Progress_handle_sock_event(422): <br>MPIDU_Socki_handle_read(649)..............: connection failure (set=0,sock=3,errno=104:(strerror() not found))<br>
[cli_1]: aborting job:<br>Fatal error in MPI_Finalize: Other MPI error, error stack:<br>MPI_Finalize(220).........................: MPI_Finalize failed<br>MPI_Finalize(146).........................: <br>MPID_Finalize(206)........................: an error occurred while the device was waiting for all open connections to close<br>
MPIDI_CH3_Progress_wait(199)..............: an error occurred while handling an event returned by MPIDU_Sock_Wait()<br>MPIDI_CH3I_Progress_handle_sock_event(422): <br>MPIDU_Socki_handle_read(649)..............: connection failure (set=0,sock=4,errno=104:(strerror() not found))<br>
rank 3 in job 4&nbsp; mahmoud-desktop_33023&nbsp;&nbsp; caused collective abort of all ranks<br>&nbsp; exit status of rank 3: killed by signal 9 <br>rank 0 in job 4&nbsp; mahmoud-desktop_33023&nbsp;&nbsp; caused collective abort of all ranks<br>&nbsp; exit status of rank 0: killed by signal 11 <br>
<br>I&#39;m failing to find a reason as my programs work fine with gcc 4.2. If it is a known bug that has been already fixed please send tell me how to fix it on my own machine.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Yours faithfully.<br>
