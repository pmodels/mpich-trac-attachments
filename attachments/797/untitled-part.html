Hi,<br><br>
I seem to have inadvertently broken some aspect the mpich2 installer,
file<br>
mpich2-1.1.1p1-win-ia32.msi,<br>
I have tried many things, and I cannot install mpich2 on my
computer.<br><br>
Please help me.&nbsp; I am working on a time critical project, and now I
am dead in the water.<br><br>
The sequence of events was<br>
1.&nbsp; installed 2.1.1 (above file) on top of my old version without
deinstalling the old version<br>
2.&nbsp; noticed two entries for MPICH2 in Add / Remove programs.<br>
3.&nbsp; decided I should deinstall them both and reinstall a fresh
copy.<br>
4.&nbsp; deinstalled the oldest one first (version 1.0 something)<br>
5.&nbsp; tried to deinstall the newest one second. (version 1.1)<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>deinstall
failed.&nbsp; Said there was an error in the installer.<br>
6.&nbsp; tried to reinstall the newest 1.1.1 again.&nbsp; Again,
installer failed.&nbsp; Error message is below.<br><br>

7.&nbsp; Sopped and disabled MPICH Daemon <br>
8.&nbsp; Tied again and it failed.<br>
8.&nbsp; Went into regedit and removed most entries related to MPICH2,
trying to get a clean state<br>
9.&nbsp; Ran installer again and got the same message.<br>
10.&nbsp; Deinstalled MPICH.&nbsp; That worked fine.<br>
11.&nbsp; Removed all folders and files I could find assosiated with
mpich and mpich2.<br>
12.&nbsp; Ran installer again and got the same message.<br>
13.&nbsp; Thinking maybe the Windows installer was at fault, I went to
Microsoft and upgraded my Windoew Installer to version 4.5 (for Win
XP-SP2).<br>
14.&nbsp; Ran installer again and got the same results.<br><br>
So, evidently it is not a problem with Windows Installer, and it may not
be a problem with your file, per se (I downloaded it several
times).&nbsp; But it seems to be a problem where it is looking for a
registry entry and can't find what it wants.&nbsp; In other words, if the
registry is not in a clean state, I guess it fails.<br><br>
Is there any way to do a clean install from scratch so I can get past
this?<br><br>
Thanks,<br><br>
