<p>Hello, i was hoping you could help me out. <br>
<br>
I am unable to find a clear answer to this question:<br>
<br>
Is it possible to communicate between Linux and Windows machines using MPICH2 with SMPD as the process manager?<br>
<br>
In the literature, there is mention of the Windows credentials but nothing on Linux credentials. It is said that MPICH2 should be preferred unless heterogenous data types are used- therefore, should be be preferred even with heterogenous clusters? <br>
<br>
If i am missing something, can you point me to where SMPD credentials are made in Linux? <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
