<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;Hi,<BR>
&nbsp; Can you check the status of the smpd daemon (smpd -status)? Did you try &quot;smpd -getphrase&quot; to specify the passphrase manually ?<BR>
&nbsp; If the commands don't work try running the commands from a command prompt &quot;Run as administrator&quot; (Right-click on command prompt icon to &quot;Run as administrator&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
(PS: We have seen problems with MPICH2 installation on Vista before, but not a problem with missing passphrase.)<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
