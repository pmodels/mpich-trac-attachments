<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hi,<BR>
&nbsp;Try uninstalling and installing MPICH2 and make sure that you specify the passphrase during the install (One of the installation steps prompt you for the passphrase. Leave the passphrase as it is to make sure that you are not missing anything.)<BR>
&nbsp;Let us know if it works for you.<BR>
&nbsp;You might have problems with VF 6.0 since it is very old (We don't test this configuration regularly on our systems).<BR>
